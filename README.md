The high level design of your server and client:
There are two parts of application in this project: a server and a client.
The client application can be used to run as ./client <Hostname> <port><filename>. 
In the application, it includes socket, connect, write and read, and close section that can be used to connect with the server side, and send datas. 
The Server application can be used to run as ./server <PORT> <FILE-DIR>.
In the applicaton, it includes socket, bind, listen, accept, write and read, and then read and close. 
The server side are used to accept the file from the client side and save it into a folder.
